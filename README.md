# Solar Tracking using Brute Force Algorithm
Welcome to the Solar Tracking using Brute Force algorithm! This Arduino code enables solar panels to track the sun's current orientation using a brute force algorithm.
## How to Use

1. **Upload the Code:**
   Upload the `Solar_Tracking_Brute_Force_Algorithm.ino` file to your Arduino board using the Arduino IDE or any compatible programming environment.

2. **Automatic Tracking:**
   After uploading, the solar tracker will automatically start working. It continuously adjusts the orientation of the solar panels to maximize sun exposure.
